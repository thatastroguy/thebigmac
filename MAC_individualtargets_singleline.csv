Sergeev+07 looked at 30 years of and fonud no evidence of Hbeta line and continuum variability except for in 1972-1988; no obvious support for binary scenario. Both Bon+ and Li+ claim periodicity in this object based on long baseline observations (several decades); Bon+ suggests the periodicity could be due to a stellar mass body impacting the accretion disk of the SMBH; Li+ propose a binary SMBH model can explain the periodicity of 14 years (but only ~2 cycles have been observed). Ilic+2017 really only brings this up in the context of the Li+ result and how a binary could affect the mass measurements from reverberation mapping.

Hjorn and Lehar find no lens galaxy. Giallongo+ argue in favor of lens  based on proximity effect. Thus the binary hypothesis has not yet been ruled out. I think Gaia resolves only a single source (based on Simbad listing). Lehar fails to find a lense galaxy. We're missing papers by bahcall+92.

Gaskell claims constant radial velocity change in Hbeta line over a 20 year period. If due to orbital motion SMBHs are separated by ~0.3pc. Shapovalova+2001 dismiss the binary hypothesis and find that the emission can be modeled by an inclined accretion disk. Eracleous+ also dismissed the binary hypothesis due to the fact that the velocity shifts observed by Gaskell+ do not follow the extrapolation of the binary model using data points from a longer baseline. They also observe that the trend in velocity of the red peak of the Halpha line is also not consistent with orbital models. Gezari+ also argue against binary and find no correlation between the coherent regions of the profile that vary across decades. Liu+2016 argues the binary hypothesis is incompatible with data spanning several decades (either the periods are longer than 20 years or other mechanisms give rise to the observed emission line velocity changes) and provides additional arguments against the binary hypothesis outside of the spectroscopic analysis. Doan+ strongly disfavor binary hypothesis based on multiple tests including estimates on the lower mass limit for the putative binary. Krause+ claims jet precession. Not sure where the separation here comes from.

Separation not based on X-ray coordinates but on work by Heckman. Garcia-Marin+2006 found that location B1 in NGC 3690 had syefert like ratios whereas Perez-Torres report the discovery of a LLAGN in IC 694 based on VLBI imaging from EVN. Alonso-Herrero+2013 presented evidence in support of the scenario in which both AGNs are deeply buried but Ptak+2015 found no evidence for more than one AGN in NuSTAR imaging. But the findings by Ptak+2015 do not necessarily disagree with the findings of the previous papers; a non-detection in IC 694 would be expected if it is indeed a LLAGN and deeply embedded. Anastasopoulou+ results do not give evidence for a buried or a weak AGN in Arp299A.

Chornock argue that it is an unusual double peak emitter. While there is a double optical K-band and radio sources (shown by Wrobel+ Decarli+ and Lauer+) Lauer+ show that the dual AGN hypothesis is not consistent with the data. While they do not rule out the binary hypothesis they do state that the Double-Peaked scenario could be true. Chornock+2010 argue in favor again of the Double-Peaked emitter hypothesis. They show the broad emission components arise from the same region and no velocity shifts are observed in the spectra across ~1 year. Chornock+ vannot conclusively rule out binary but prefer Double-Peaked emitter. Gaskell+ also argues in favor of the Double-Peaked emitter hypothesis. Coordinates drawn from the naming convention but we should consider changing these to the positions of the radio nuclei. Bondi+ show that there do exist two compact radio nuclei in J1536 as well as in the companion 0.97'' away confirming the presnce of two AGNs in the vicinity. They bring up that the Chornock conclusion was based on data obtained in seeing conditions worse than the angular separation of the two so the conclusion about spatially coincident broad lines may not be true. While Bondi do not make any firm conclusions on the nature of J1536 they do clearly confirm the VLA-A and VLA-B sources detected by Wrobel+ with a separation 0.97'' or ~5.1kpc separation. Need to update this liting.

Murgia+ detects two radio cores with VLA 1.4 GHz imaging (and possible 4.8 GHz as well) coincident with the two dumbell components in HST imaging. Separation of 7.1''. I think the radio sources have inverted and flat radio spectra? Merritt+ Gobal-Krishna+ and Zier+ explain the X-shaped radio morphology in terms of a spin-flip after a SMBH merger (hence this is a dual AGN candidate and an AGN recoil candidate). Hodges-Kluck+ report the presence of X-ray sources in both dumbbell components. Core 1 has a power law component and an AGN is favored. In core 2 there is no clear nuclear point source but they do find a power law frozen at Gamma=2 aids the fit. Hard emission could arise from XRBs but they cannot rule out an AGN in core 2 due to the detected radio core at ~1 GHz. This is cross listed as a dual AGN candidate and a recoil candidate.

Mrk 501 shows a roughly 79 deg twist in the PA of the jet between the pc and kpc scales. They argue this is due to the orbital motion of the binary. Villata+ argue this precession structure is due to the black hole spin axis and so the helical structure is driven by one of the black holes in the binary. Bhatta+ report a 332 day QPO in this system (that persists for up to 7 cycles) and could be driven by a SMBH (among other things). Rieger+07 lists it in their table of binary candidates.

Separation from Civano+2010. Redshift from Civano+2010. Comerford argues in favor of a dual AGN in this system; Civano+10 argues that the system could be described by a recoiling SMBH or a dual AGN (Type I/Type II) with the Type I AGN recoiling. Blecha+13 finds the system can also be described using the recoiling / dual AGN+recoiling hypothesis. Ciavno+2012 uses Chandra HRC and finds only one of optical nuclei is responsible for whole X-ray unobscured; one of the nuclei is more consistent with a SF region and so they favor the GW recoil scenario rather than a dual AGN scenario; but a scenario involving a heavily obscured nucleus in the second nucleus cannot be fully ruled out. Lanzuisi+ analyzes the XMM spectrum to investigate the P-Cygni profile. Wrobel+14 finds no radio emission at the positions of the two nuclei; the NW nucleear properties are consistent with a CT AGN; they argue that CID-42 is either a dual AGN or a Type II CT AGN and a recoiling AGN where the recoiling AGN was ejected due to a triple SMBH interaction.

Fabbiano originally reported dual AGN based on subbinned Chandra imaging and spectra of the two observed sources. Fabbiano also reported that the HST optical image and water maser were offset from one another. Imanishi+ note that no secondary nucleus is observed in their near-IR imaging despite the fact that their AO imaging should have detected the secondary nucleus. Koss+ use a 340 ks exposure to show that there is likely only a single AGN (falls between the position of the two reported previously) and uses simulations to show the previous detection of two sources was likely statistical noise. They also show the Xray UV optical and NIR emission are consistent with a single source rather than being offset.

Target does not appear to overlap with any double-peaked sample from 2009 and 2010. Frey+ report on EVN 1.7 GHz and 5 GHz imaging. Preliinary 1.7 GHz imaging revealed a dual radio structure separated by 440 mas. At 1.7 GHz both sources are detected but at 5 GHz only the brighter NW component is detected. Coordinates and separations are based on radio imaging by Frey+. The radio spectra are quite different as reported by Frey+; NW is flat and the upper limit on SW slope is steep(?). Both sources are consistent with arising from AGNs. Overall the radio imaging is consistent with the presence of two AGNs but an alternative scenario where the secondary source is actually a hotspot associated with a shock in a jet cannot be ruled out.

Tavani+ report ocurrence of a new peak in 2017 as expected from previous observations (with period of ~2.2yr) and argue in favor of the binary hypothesis. Sandrinelli+2018 also find statistically significant periodicity shortly after Tavani+ but I am not sure if they are using the latest data like Tavani+. CHECK. Cavaliere+ developed a model to describe dynamic events in blazars and specifically BL LACs; they show their model can procide a simple explanation for the recurrent but non-linear pattern of peaks and troughs in the light curves of PG 1553+113. Munar-Androver shows full view of fifth repetition of pattern again confirming repetition of the main peak as well as the lower intensity peaks before and after the dominant maxima. Caproni+ identify 7 jet components that recede ballistically from the core and their ejection is roughly coincident with previous gamma ray flares. They find that the jet prcesses with a period roughly equivalent with that derived via quasi-periodicities. Covino+ argue that that there is no strong case for year-long quasi-periodicities and the power spectrum is consistent with being generated by red noise.

Leighly+ shows that a binary scenario is unnecessary and likely untenable with the data.

Both are optically AGNs based on emission line ratios but N2 shows stronger [OIII]. Thus N2 is a possible secondary nucleus with an AGN. No compact radio source coincides with N2 so it is likely radio quiet and obscured given the lack of broad lines. No counterpart to N2 is seen with Chandra eMERLIN or HST (with the exception of HST F606W which shows an elongated feature coincident with N2). Thus they cannot rule out that N2 is a bright knot of emission caused by a jet-cloud interaction. They disfavor this scenario because (1) such interactions usually produce broad lines (2) N2 is not located along th jet axis but along an edge of the eastern lobe (3) the ionization structure at N2's location would be a fortuitous spatial coincidence and (4) N2 has a very high line luminosity (~10^42 erg s^-1). No coordinates are provided nor are distinct redshifts provided. Velocity offset measured from line peaks is roughly 200 km s^-1.

Two scenarios are proposed to explain the observed proper motion of the lens images: (1) a single AGN scenario where the proper motion is due to knots moving along a jet or (2) the magnified object is a dual radio-loud AGN separated by ~175 pc in projection and both have core-jet morphologies. The latter scenario is driven mostly by the motion of the flat-spectrum radio components. Additional observations are needed. They remark in the paper that a single AGN scenario may not be compatible with the observations. Coordinates of radio components are given relative to the lens; for now I am only listing the coordinates from NED.

Companion could shows Seyfert-like emission but they cannot rule out the case of an EELR or ionization by the nearby QSO. Distance between the centers of the galaxies found to be 3.0'' for hte 3 D spectra. We adopt that for the separation. Radial velocity difference quoted as 120 km per s. Sun+ argue that the QSO is indeed recoiling w/ radial velocity ~1400 km per s and is accompanied by a circular disk that emits the observed double peaks. Other scenarios involve a circular disk with spiral emissivity perturbations and emissions from bipolar outflow. If the companion does in fact host its own AGN rather than being ionized by the primary QSO or overlaps with the EELR of the primary QSO then this system would consistute a dual AGN as well. Coordinates are not provided for either the primary QSO or the nucleus of the companion. Need to come back and mark the long-slit and optical imaging as analysis methods.

It has UV optical X-ray and radio counterparts. They rule out a foreground or background AGN scenario. Optical spectra suggest photoionization by an accretion powered source and the emission lines palce the emitting region within NGC 5252. Kim+2015 cannot rule out that the primary nucleus is responsible for the ionization seen but they argue that the photionization is more likely due to the ULX and that the ULX hosts an IMBH and argue that it likely originated from a dwarf galaxy that was accreted. Kim+2017 find that the OIII emission line ratios peak near the position of the ULX (and without any change in electron density or enhanced metallicity in the vicinity of the ULX implies the ULX is the power source) and they find evidence of rotation around the ULX position. In fact they find that the gas around the ULX has significantly lower Halpha/[NII] than the main galaxy and thus the metallicity is lower. This again agrees with the idea that this ULX originated from a low metallicity low mass galaxy. These observations reaffirm that the background QSO scenario is unlikely. Yang+ detect the radio source in EVN observations and report that it has a high brightness temperature a partially optically thick radio spectrum and a relatively stable luminosity and identify the source as a radio core of the offnuclear object. The radio structure at 1.66 GHz is compact (parsec-scale) and has a flat spectrum. They argue the offnuclear source is a SMBH and a LLAGN. However Mezcua+ examined follow-up VLBA imaging that resolve the radio core into two components separated by 2.9mas at 4.4 GHz but a single unresolved source is identified at 7.6 GHz. Mezcua+ identify the western source as the core and the eastern source as a jet. Rather than a SMBH Mezcua+ argue that the ULX hosts an IMBH and that it originated in a compact dwarf galaxy that was accreted by NGC 5252.

Brightest portion of the radio jet could be a core-jet structure or jet knot; the coordinates for this are used a A+B position. Another source (X) resides to the north. X has a high brightness temp and flat spectrum consistent with being the optically thick base of a jet. The nature of this source is uncertain and needs further attention. If it is a secondary SMBH this would be a binary. However this secondary SMBH could not explain the precession of the jet nor can it account for the double-peaked lines. These latter two phenomenon are likely caused by a jet-NLR interaction. No coordinates for X are provided.

Very unusual source; the eission is localized to an off nuclear position and within ~12pc based on K band imaging and <22pc based on Pa-beta with colors consistent with local quasars. SII and OI optical diagnostics imply Seyfert emission but OIII diagnostic implies HII region. Broad emission lines are observed but with no velocity offset (so if it is recoiling SMBH the velocity is transverse to the LOS). The source persists for ~63 years and shows variability in brightness but shows no significant color evolution. Broad Fe II and broad NIR Ca II lines are present as well as a statistically significant blue power law continuum with no detected host absorption lines. Also shows relatively constant UV luminosity. However rapid drop in luminosity in 2002-2003 narrow Fe II and Ca II lines are difficult to reconcile with AGN. This system is likely a recoiling AGN OR an eruptive LBV star outbursting for decades before resulting in a Type IIn SN.

This is flagged as serendipitous because the authors were not intentionally looking for a dual but instead were obatining new optical imaging and spectroscopy to better understand the host and the AGN of the radio/optical emitter which turned out to be two distinct AGNs. Mid-IR spectroscopy enabled through Spitzer but this spectroscopy was used to investigate the star formation more than the AGNs. So we do not list it as a confirmation method.

They find that both components are AGNs on the BPT diagram and the central component is an a composite on the NII diagram and SBs in the other two diagrams. They argue the components show emission line ratios of a Sy2+SB and 2 AGN components. Several scenarioes could explain this: (1) rotating disc or ring (2) outflows (3) jet-driven outflow (4) a binary AGN + AGN+SB composite. They do not see prominent asymmetric wings so they seem to disfavor an outflow hypothesis. I think in the binary scenario they are arguing for the presence of a binary ALONG WITH a third AGN.

They note an extension toward the north. U+2013 examined this system with Keck and find the nucleus is resolved into three components: N SW and SE. They find a rotating gaseous disk in the N component; the enclosed gas suggests the presence of a SMBH at the center. They identify bright K' and H-band continua along with the [Si VI] coronal line in the SW component and argue that previously identified obscured AGN likely resides in the SW component. They suggest the N AGN may be heavily obscured. Imanishi+ note that both nuclei are selected as IR AGNs using their near-IR color criteria. Iwasawa+2018 return to this with NuSTAR; when fitting the data with an obscured single power law they noticed the resulting power law index remained remarkably hard. Because of this they tested a two AGN modelw here both are heavily obscured; the model describes the data well as is comparable to if not a better fit than the single AGN model. They find the N source to be CT and the SW source to be obscured with 2e+23 cm-2. They also argue that a two AGN scenario is supported by the observed variability above and below 10 keV. They cannot rule out a single X-ray scenario but the introduce of a second AGN does offer a simpler explanation for the observed spectral hardness and is consistent with what U+2013 found. COORDINATES AND REDSHIFTS ARE NOT UNIQUE. Barrows+ selected this as an offset AGN but it is a dual AGN.

The Chandra image is consistent with only a single source centered ont he quasar position. They favor a recoil scenario as the most likely scenarrio but they cannot rule out scenarios such as an extreme disk emitter; a peculiar background QSO associated with an undermassive host; and/or involving peculiar winds. Chiaberge+2018 study Keck OSIRIS IFU data; they find that the emitting regions are complex and they find evidence for AGN feedback. They find three distinct spectral components assocated with spatially distinct emission-line regions. Their findings are consistent with Chiaberge+2017 but are not conclusive.

The secondary could be X-ray weak but such objects apparently have only been found to be BAL QSOs and there is no evidence that this is a BAL QSO.

Draper+ examined the polarized light ; their data seem to suggest a central ionizing source and I'm not sure how this fits in the picture. Tadhunter and Young presented spectropolarimetric observations revealing broad lines; I don't think either of these offered any evidence for multiple AGNs and I don't think their observations could resolve multiple components. Filippenko+ found evidence for broad Halpha wings in the brighter nucleus and Robinson+2000 found evidence for broad Halpha in the weaker nucleus. Evans+2008 performed a multiwavelength study and claimed the discovery of obscured AGNs in both nuclei based on Chandra observations and they suggest that the secondary AGN could have been triggered by the jet from the primary interacting with the secondary and driving material toward/onto the secondary SMBH. Evans quote the works by Fileppenko+ Robinson+ and Draper+ in addition to their own evidence that there are indeed two AGNs in this system.

Both sources show fairly flat spectra ; the two sources have fairly different spectral indices based on VLA 1.4 4.9 8.5 and 14.9 GHz obs. The different spectral indices deso not disqualify lens hypothesis but apparently disfavors dark lens. HST and Keck imaging suggest A is unresolved and B might be slightly extended. No spectroscopic emission detected from B nor is there evidence for a lens galaxy in the spectra of A component. Spectral lines detected in A and not B would seem to argue against lens?

Separation in arcseconds is not listed. Coordinates are not listed. Note: we list the coordinates for the first object using the Simbad radio coordinates but no coordinates are available for the second sourec; we leave this blank. Kharb+ discuss the possibility that the binary was hardened by a third SMBH which was slungshot out and now resides in the second nucleus but this cannot be true; you would not expect a second bright nucleus in this case if the third is quiescent. A relatistic jet cannot be ruled out. Both of the detected radio sources (separated by 4.8 pc) are in the N1 nucleus.

Liu+2016 followed up with additional baseline info for this target and two others selected from MD09 and find that this system is not consistent with the previously proposed simple sinusoidal model across a baseline of 5-12 years. Mooley+ examined VLA and VLBA imaging to study the pc-to-kpc scale structure. Two sources in VLBA one being the core and the other likely being a component ejected from the core. Vaughan+ briefly discuss this and argue that the short period from Liu+'s original paper is not trustworthy. Foord+ examine X-rays and multiwavelength properties and find no evidence for the bonary hypothesis.
