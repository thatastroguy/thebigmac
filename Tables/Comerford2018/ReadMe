Abstract:
    Double-peaked narrow emission lines in active galactic nucleus (AGN)
    spectra can be produced by AGN outflows, rotation, or dual AGNs, which
    are AGN pairs in ongoing galaxy mergers. Consequently, double-peaked
    narrow AGN emission lines are useful tracers of the coevolution of
    galaxies and their supermassive black holes, as driven by AGN feedback
    and AGN fueling. We investigate this concept further with follow-up
    optical longslit observations of a sample of 95 Sloan Digital Sky
    Survey (SDSS) galaxies that have double-peaked narrow AGN emission
    lines. Based on a kinematic analysis of the longslit spectra, we
    confirm previous work that finds that the majority of double-peaked
    narrow AGN emission lines are associated with outflows. We also find
    that eight of the galaxies have companion galaxies with line-of-sight
    velocity separations <500km/s and physical separations <30kpc. Since
    we find evidence of AGNs in both galaxies, all eight of these systems
    are compelling dual AGN candidates. Galaxies with double-peaked narrow
    AGN emission lines occur in such galaxy mergers at least twice as
    often as typical active galaxies. Finally, we conclude that at least
    3% of SDSS galaxies with double-peaked narrow AGN emission lines are
    found in galaxy mergers where both galaxies are resolved in SDSS
    imaging.

Description:
    Of the 95 z>0.1 galaxies in our sample, we previously observed 54 of
    them with the Kast Spectrograph at Lick Observatory (3m telescope,
    pixel size 0.78") in 2009 April-August and 2010 January-July, the
    Double Spectrograph (DBSP) at Palomar Observatory (5m telescope, pixel
    size 0.47" for the red detector and 0.39" for the blue detector) on
    2010 December 1-2, and the Blue Channel Spectrograph at MMT
    Observatory (6.5m telescope, pixel size 0.29") in 2010.

    In addition, we obtained, in 2010, optical longslit observations of
    41 more z>0.1 double-peaked AGNs with GMOS-North on the Gemini
    Observatory North 8m telescope (pixel size 0.073" for 1x1 pixel
    binning and 0.145" for 1x2 pixel binning), GMOS-South on the Gemini
    Observatory South 8m telescope (pixel size 0.073" for 1x1 pixel
    binning and 0.146" for 1x2 pixel binning), LRIS on the Keck I 10m
    telescope (pixel size 0.135"), and DEIMOS on the Keck II 10m telescope
    (pixel size 0.119").
