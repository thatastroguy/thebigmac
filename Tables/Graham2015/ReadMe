Abstract:
    Hierarchical assembly models predict a population of supermassive
    black hole (SMBH) binaries. These are not resolvable by direct imaging
    but may be detectable via periodic variability (or nanohertz frequency
    gravitational waves). Following our detection of a 5.2-year periodic
    signal in the quasar PG 1302-102, we present a novel analysis of the
    optical variability of 243 500 known spectroscopically confirmed
    quasars using data from the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS)
    to look for close (<0.1pc) SMBH systems. Looking for a strong
    Keplerian periodic signal with at least 1.5 cycles over a baseline of
    nine years, we find a sample of 111 candidate objects. This is in
    conservative agreement with theoretical predictions from models of
    binary SMBH populations. Simulated data sets, assuming stochastic
    variability, also produce no equivalent candidates implying a low
    likelihood of spurious detections. The periodicity seen is likely
    attributable to either jet precession, warped accretion discs or
    periodic accretion associated with a close SMBH binary system. We also
    consider how other SMBH binary candidates in the literature appear in
    CRTS data and show that none of these are equivalent to the identified
    objects. Finally, the distribution of objects found is consistent with
    that expected from a gravitational-wave-driven population. This
    implies that circumbinary gas is present at small orbital radii and is
    being perturbed by the black holes. None of the sources is expected to
    merge within at least the next century. This study opens a new unique
    window to study a population of close SMBH binaries that must exist
    according to our current understanding of galaxy and SMBH evolution.

Description:
    CRTS leverages the Catalina Sky Survey data streams from three
    telescopes - the 0.7m Catalina Sky Survey Schmidt and 1.5m Mount
    Lemmon Survey telescopes in Arizona, and the 0.5m Siding Springs
    Survey Schmidt in Australia - used in a search for Near-Earth
    Objects, operated by Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at University of
    Arizona. CRTS covers up to ~2500deg^2^ per night, with four exposures
    per visit, separated by 10-min, over 21 nights per lunation. All data
    are automatically processed in real-time, and optical transients are
    immediately distributed using a variety of electronic mechanisms. The
    data are broadly calibrated to Johnson V (see Drake et al., 2013,
    Cat. J/ApJ/763/32 for details) and the full CRTS data set contains
    time series for approximately 500 million sources.

    The Million Quasars (MQ) catalogue v3.7 contains all spectroscopically
    confirmed type 1 QSOs (309525), AGN (21728) and BL Lacs (1573) in the
    literature up to 2013 November 26 and formed the basis for the results
    of Graham et al. (2015Natur.518...74G). We have extended this with
    297301 spectroscopically identified quasars in the SDSS Data Release
    12 (Paris et al., in preparation). We cross-matched this combined
    quasar list against the CRTS data set with a 3-arcsec matching radius
    and find that 334446 confirmed quasars are covered by the full CRTS.

    Our final sample consists of 111 quasars.
