Abstract:
    We present spectroscopy of binary quasar candidates, with component
    separations of 3"<={Delta}{theta}<6", selected from SDSS DR4 using
    kernel density estimation (KDE). Of our 27 new quasar pair
    observations, 10 are binary quasars, which doubles the number of known
    g<21 binaries with 3"<={Delta}{theta}<6" separations. Several of our
    observed binaries are wide-separation lens candidates that merit
    additional higher resolution spectroscopy, as well as deep imaging to
    search for lensing galaxies. Our candidates are initially selected by
    UV excess (u-g<1), but are otherwise selected irrespective of the
    relative colors of the quasar pair, and we thus use them to suggest
    optimal color similarity and photometric redshift approaches for
    targeting binary quasars or projected quasar pairs. We find that a
    third or more of all binary quasars have quite dissimilar components
    on the basis of a typical color similarity criterion
    ({chi}^2^_color_<~20). From a sample that is complete on proper scales
    of 23.7h^-1^kpc<R_prop_<29.9h^-1^kpc, we determine the projected
    quasar correlation function.

Description:
    Spectroscopy of our DR4 KDE binary quasar candidates was obtained with
    the Ritchey-Chretien Spectrograph on the Mayall 4m telescope at Kitt
    Peak National Observatory (KPNO) over five nights (UT 2007 February
    22-26). We used a 1.5"x98" long slit set at the position angle of the
    candidate binary, which allowed both components to be simultaneously
    observed.

Note on table2.dat: We define a binary quasar by a line-of-sight velocity
     difference of |{Delta}v_//_|<2000km/s in the rest frame of either
     component. The pair containing SDSS J143002.66+071415.6 has a velocity
     difference of |{Delta}v_//_|=2000+/-400km/s, which is just inside our
     definition of a binary. Components are denoted A and B such that the
     position angle from A to B lies between 0{deg} and 180{deg}.
Note on table4.dat: The ambiguities, and why we conclude that SDSS
     J1235+6836 and SDSS J1507+2903 are binaries but the other pairs are
     not, are discussed in Section 2.2.2.

Note (1): The zSDSS column shows matches to any spectroscopic object in the
     SDSS DR6 Catalog Archive Server (mainly, e.g., Schneider et al. 2007,
     Cat. VII/252 obsoleted by VII/260). In the zSDSS and "Our z" columns
     (z), the object is a quasar at the provided redshift, unless otherwise
     noted.
Note (2): Flag as follows:
    P = SDSS J1320+3056A first appeared with a confirmed redshift (z=1.587) in
        Veron-Cetty et al. (2004, Cat. VII/235 obsoleted by VII/258).
    N = SDSS J112556.32+143148.0 is a NELG (narrow emission line galaxy).
    O = Subsequent to our observations, SDSS J094309.36+103401.3 appeared in
        Inada et al. (2008, Cat. J/AJ/135/496) with z=1.433.

    * SDSS J123122.37+493430.7 which is based on a single CIV emission line,
      with weak confirming CIII].
    * D = derived from a single emission line. This differs from the single
      question mark notation, as the redshift is based on similar emission
      in the other component (rather than simply assuming that the emission
      is MgII).
Note (4): Following equation 1. See section 3.
Note (5): An asterisk denotes that our spectroscopy alone is insufficient
     to rule out a lens interpretation for this pair (see Section 2.2.1).
