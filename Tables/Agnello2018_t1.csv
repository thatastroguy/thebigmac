Model-accepted candidates from ATLAS DR2 (first sub-list), SDSS control set (second sub-list), and ATLAS-DR3 (third sub-list) targets, that were observed with long-slit spectroscopy at NOT and NTT over 2016. The quoted i-band magnitudes are AperMag6 for ATLAS and model for SDSS. The DR3 targets were not graded. ‘NLG’ stands for ‘narrow-line galaxy’. A1116−0657, given in the last line, was re-discovered during the search in the DR2 footprint and is the known lens, small-separation quad HE1113−0641 (Blackburne, Wisotzki & Schechter 2008, not re-observed). (s) Classification of some objects was aided by imaging with the SOAR Adaptive Optics Module (in z΄ band; 2016 June, November, December; PI Motta), especially for NLG pairs that could not be otherwise resolved. *Asterisks mark the NIQs that were targeted independently as described by Schechter et al. (2017). A0140−1152 is spectroscopically confirmed as a lens with zl = 0.277 (Fig. 4). (k) A2213−2652 has been confirmed as a lens through a subsequent imaging campaign (2017 October, PI Treu).
