Abstract:
    We present optical long-slit observations of the complete sample of 71
    Type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with double-peaked narrow
    emission lines at z<0.1 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Double-peaked
    emission lines are produced by a variety of mechanisms including disk
    rotation, kiloparsec-scale dual AGNs, and narrow-line region (NLR)
    kinematics (outflows or inflows). We develop a novel kinematic
    classification technique to determine the nature of these objects
    using long-slit spectroscopy alone. We determine that 86% of the
    double-peaked profiles are produced by moderate-luminosity AGN
    outflows, 6% are produced by rotation, and 8% are ambiguous. While we
    are unable to directly identify dual AGNs with long-slit data alone,
    we explore their potential kinematic classifications with this method.
    We also find a positive correlation between the NLR size and
    luminosity of the AGN NLRs (R_NLR_{propto}L_[OIII]_^0.21+/-0.05^),
    indicating a clumpy two-zone ionization model for the NLR.

Description:
    To determine the nature of 71 Type 2 AGNs with double-peaked [OIII]
    emission lines in SDSS that are at z<0.1 and further characterize
    their properties, we observe them using two complementary follow-up
    methods: optical long-slit spectroscopy and Jansky Very Large Array
    (VLA) radio observations.

    We use various spectrographs with similar pixel scales (Lick Kast
    Spectrograph; Palomar Double Spectrograph; MMT Blue Channel
    Spectrograph; APO Dual Imaging Spectrograph and Keck DEep Imaging
    Multi-Object Spectrograph. We use a 1200 lines/mm grating for all
    spectrographs; see table 1.

    In future work, we will combine our long-slit observations with the
    VLA data for the full sample of 71 galaxies (O. Muller-Sanchez+ 2016,
    in preparation).

Note (2): The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is a least squares statistic
          that introduces a penalty for additional parameters, defined by
          Akaike (1974ITAC...19..716A). Numerically, AIC={chi}^2^+2k,
          where k is the number of parameters and {chi}^2^ is the
          chi-square statistic. See section 2.3 for further explanations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note (1): The 1{sigma} error on the measured value straddles the classification
          cutoff for some objects, e.g. J0135+1435. However, as the measured
          value of J0135+1435 is greater than 500 km/s we classify this galaxy
          accordingly as Outflow Composite. For all other galaxies in our sample
          in which the measured value straddles a given classification cutoff
          within error are classified according to the measured value.
Note (2): The number of components is >2 if at either position angle, more
          than half the rows within the spatial center of the galaxy have >2
          components as the best fit.
Note (3): Alignment is determined from PA[OIII] and PAgal. If these two
          measurements are within 20{deg} of one another, the galaxy is aligned.
