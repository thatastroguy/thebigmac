Abstract:
    A small fraction of quasars have long been known to show bulk velocity
    offsets (of a few hundred to thousands of km/s) in the broad Balmer
    lines with respect to the systemic redshift of the host galaxy. Models
    to explain these offsets usually invoke broad-line region gas
    kinematics/asymmetry around single black holes (BHs), orbital motion
    of massive (~sub-parsec (sub-pc)) binary black holes (BBHs), or recoil
    BHs, but single-epoch spectra are unable to distinguish between these
    scenarios. The line-of-sight (LOS) radial velocity (RV) shifts from
    long-term spectroscopic monitoring can be used to test the BBH
    hypothesis. We have selected a sample of 399 quasars with
    kinematically offset broad H{beta} lines from the Sloan Digital Sky
    Survey (SDSS) Seventh Data Release quasar catalog, and have conducted
    second-epoch optical spectroscopy for 50 of them. Combined with the
    existing SDSS spectra, the new observations enable us to constrain the
    LOS RV shifts of broad H{beta} lines with a rest-frame baseline of a
    few years to nearly a decade. While previous work focused on objects
    with extreme velocity offset (>10^3^ km/s), we explore the parameter
    space with smaller (a few hundred km/s) yet significant offsets (99.7%
    confidence). Using cross-correlation analysis, we detect significant
    (99% confidence) radial accelerations in the broad H{beta} lines in 24
    of the 50 objects, of ~10-200 km/s/yr with a median measurement
    uncertainty of ~10 km/s/yr, implying a high fraction of variability of
    the broad-line velocity on multi-year timescales. We suggest that 9 of
    the 24 detections are sub-pc BBH candidates, which show consistent
    velocity shifts independently measured from a second broad line
    (either H{alpha} or Mg II) without significant changes in the
    broad-line profiles. Combining the results on the general quasar
    population studied in Paper I (Shen et al. 2013ApJ...775...49S), we
    find a tentative anti-correlation between the velocity offset in the
    first-epoch spectrum and the average acceleration between two epochs,
    which could be explained by orbital phase modulation when the time
    separation between two epochs is a non-negligible fraction of the
    orbital period of the motion causing the line displacement. We discuss
    the implications of our results for the identification of sub-pc BBH
    candidates in offset-line quasars and for the constraints on their
    frequency and orbital parameters.

Description:
    We start with the SDSS DR7 quasar catalog (Schneider et al.
    2010AJ....139.2360S, Cat. VII/260), adopting the spectral measurements
    of Shen et al. (2011, J/ApJS/194/45). Among the SDSS DR7 quasars,
    20,774 are at z < 0.83, where SDSS spectra cover H{beta} and [O III]
    {lambda}{lambda}4959, 5007 (hereafter [O III] for short). From this
    parent sample of 20,774 objects we select a subset of 399 with offset
    broad Balmer emission lines, based on the spectral region around
    H{beta} and [O III]. Our selection was a combination of automated
    spectral fitting (Shen et al. 2008, J/ApJ/680/169; 2011,
    J/ApJS/194/45) and visual examination. Here and throughout, we refer
    to the 399 objects as the "offset" sample. Using the spectral models,
    we measure the offset of the broad emission lines relative to the
    systemic velocity. The systemic redshift is estimated from the core
    component of [O III], which may be different (by a median offset of 32
    km/s with a standard deviation of 125 km/s) from the nominal redshift
    listed by the DR7 catalog based on the SDSS spectroscopic pipeline
    (Stoughton et al. 2002AJ....123..485S). Our adopted systemic redshift
    agrees with the improved redshift for SDSS quasars from Hewett & Wild
    (2010, J/MNRAS/405/2302) within uncertainties.
