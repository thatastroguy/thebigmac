Abstract:
    In an earlier paper, we presented Jansky Very Large Array
    multi-frequency, multi-array continuum imaging of a unique sample of
    low-axial ratio radio galaxies. In this paper, the second in the
    series, we examine the images to learn the phenomenology of how the
    off-axis emission relates to the main radio source.
    Inversion-symmetric offset emission appears to be bimodal and to
    originate from one of two strategic locations: outer ends of radio
    lobes (outer-deviation) or from inner ends (inner-deviation). The
    latter sources are almost always associated with edge-brightened
    sources. With S- and Z-shaped sources being a subset of
    outer-deviation sources, this class lends itself naturally to
    explanations involving black hole axis precession. Our data allow us
    to present a plausible model for the more enigmatic inner-deviation
    sources with impressive wings; as for outer-deviation sources these
    too require black hole axis shifts, although they also require plasma
    backflows into relic channels. Evolution in morphology over time
    relates the variety in structures in inner-deviation sources including
    XRGs. With features such as non- collinearities, central inner-S
    "spine," corresponding lobe emission peaks, double and protruding
    hotspots not uncommon, black hole axis precession, drifts, or flips
    could be active in a significant fraction of radio sources with
    prominent off-axis emission. At least 4% of radio galaxies appear to
    undergo black hole axis rotation. Quasars offer a key signature for
    recognizing rotating axes. With a rich haul of sources that have
    likely undergone axis rotation, our work shows the usefulness of
    low-axial ratio sources in pursuing searches for binary supermassive
    black holes.

Description:
    Roberts+ (2018, J/ApJ/852/47) present every image made of the 99
    sources from the Cheung (2007, J/AJ/133/2097) sample, both archival
    images from Roberts+ (2015, J/ApJS/220/7), and our Jansky VLA
    observations. Altogether there are 236 total intensity images. The
    sources were observed over a year from 2016 February through 2017
    January at L- and S-band in the A-, B-, and C-arrays. The resolution
    we obtained for the images in L-band is 4" (B-array), whereas in
    S-band the resolutions range from 2" to 6" (AB-, B-, and C- arrays).
