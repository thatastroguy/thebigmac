Abstract:
    1 per cent of redshift z~0.1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) show
    velocity splitting of a few hundred km/s in the narrow emission lines
    in spatially integrated spectra. Such line profiles have been found to
    arise from the bulk motion of ionized gas clouds associated with
    galactic-scale outflows, merging pairs of galaxies each harbouring a
    supermassive black hole (SMBH), and/or galactic-scale disc rotation.
    It remains unclear, however, how the frequency of narrow-line velocity
    splitting may depend on AGN luminosity. Here we study the correlation
    between the fraction of Type 2 AGNs with double-peaked narrow emission
    lines and AGN luminosity as indicated by [OIII] {lambda}5007
    emission-line luminosity L_[OIII]_. We combine the sample of Liu et
    al. (2010. Cat. J/ApJ/708/427) at z~0.1 with a new sample of 178 Type
    2 AGNs with double-peaked [OIII] emission lines at z~0.5. We select
    the new sample from a parent sample of 2089 Type 2 AGNs from the
    SDSS-III/Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We find a
    statistically significant (~4.2{sigma}) correlation between L_[OIII}]_
    and the fraction of objects that exhibit double-peaked narrow emission
    lines among all Type 2 AGNs, corrected for selection bias and
    incompleteness due to [OIII] line width, equivalent width, splitting
    velocity, and/or equivalent width ratio between the two velocity
    components. Our result suggests that galactic-scale outflows and/or
    merging pairs of SMBHs are more prevalent in more powerful AGNs,
    although spatially resolved follow-up observations are needed to
    resolve the origin(s) for the narrow-line velocity splitting for
    individual AGNs.

Description:
    We have studied the luminosity dependence of the fraction of
    double-peaked narrow emission lines in optically selected Type 2
    (obscured) AGNs using [OIII] {lambda}5007 luminosity as a surrogate
    for AGN luminosity. We have combined the sample of (Liu et al., 2010,
    Cat. J/ApJ/708/427) at z~0.1 with a new sample of 178 AGNs at z~0.5
    with double-peaked narrow lines that we have identified from the
    SDSS-III/BOSS survey. The new sample was selected from a parent sample
    of 2089 Type 2 AGNs with high quality BOSS spectra
    (amplitude-over-noise ratios >5 for all the relevant emission lines).
    It includes more galaxies at higher redshifts with larger intrinsic
    AGN luminosity which allows us to probe a large enough dynamic range
    to address the luminosity dependence.
