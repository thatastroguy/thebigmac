Abstract:
    Double-peaked [OIII] profiles in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) may
    provide evidence for the existence of dual AGNs, but a good diagnostic
    for selecting them is currently lacking. Starting from ~7000 active
    galaxies in Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7, we assemble a sample of 87
    type 2 AGNs with double-peaked [OIII] profiles. The nuclear
    obscuration in the type 2 AGNs allows us to determine redshifts of
    host galaxies through stellar absorption lines. We typically find that
    one peak is redshifted and another is blueshifted relative to the host
    galaxy. We find a strong correlation between the ratios of the shifts
    and the double peak fluxes. The correlation can be naturally explained
    by the Keplerian relation predicted by models of co-rotating dual
    AGNs. The current sample statistically favors that most of the [OIII]
    double-peaked sources are dual AGNs and disfavors other explanations,
    such as rotating disk and outflows. These dual AGNs have a separation
    distance at ~1kpc scale, showing an intermediate phase of merging
    systems. The appearance of dual AGNs is about ~10^-2^, impacting on
    the current observational deficit of binary supermassive black holes
    with a probability of ~10^-4^ (Boroson & Lauer, 2009Natur.458...53B).

Description:
    We start from the galaxy sample of SDSS DR7 and select active galaxies
    based on the widely used BPT diagram. Using the measured fluxes of
    narrow emission lines from the MPA/JHU catalog, we separate type 2
    AGNs from other sources according to their line ratios. We select
    those objects with SDSS r-band magnitude r<17.7, redshift z<=0.15, and
    equivalent width of [OIII]5007>5. In total, 6780 type 2 AGNs follow
    from this criterion. Finally, we are left with 87 sources having a
    flux ratio in the range of [0.3,3], 44 of which have high enough
    signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra to see similar double-peaked
    structures in other lines (e.g., [OIII]4959, H{beta}, H{alpha}, [NII],
    [SII]).
