Abstract:
    The morphology of selected groups of sources in the Faint Images of
    the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) survey and catalog is
    examined. Sources in the FIRST catalog (2003 April release, 811117
    entries) were sorted into singles, doubles, triples, and groups of
    higher-count membership based on a proximity criteria. The 7106 groups
    with four or more components were examined individually for bent types
    including, but not limited to, wide-angle tail and narrow-angle tail
    types. In the process of this examination, ring, double-double,
    X-shaped, hybrid morphology, giant radio sources, and the herein
    described W-shaped and tri-axial morphology systems were also
    identified. For the convenience of the reader separate tables for
    distinctive types were generated. A few curiosities were found. For
    the 16950 three-component groups and 74788 two-component groups,
    catalogs with probability estimates for bent classification, as
    determined by pattern recognition techniques, are presented.
