Abstract:
    We have carried out a systematic search for subparsec supermassive
    black hole (BH) binaries among z<~0.7 Sloan Digital Sky Survey
    quasars. These are predicted by models of supermassive BH and host
    galaxy coevolution, therefore their census and population properties
    constitute an important test of these models. In our working
    hypothesis, one of the two BHs accretes at a much higher rate than the
    other and carries with it the only broad emission line region of the
    system, making the system analogous to a single-lined spectroscopic
    binary star. Accordingly, we used spectroscopic principal component
    analysis to search for broad H{beta} emission lines that are displaced
    from the quasar rest frame by |{Delta}{nu}|>~1000km/s. This method
    also yields candidates for rapidly recoiling BHs. Of the 88
    candidates, several were previously reported in the literature. We
    found a correlation between the peak offset and skewness of the broad
    H{beta} profiles, suggesting a common physical explanation for these
    profiles. We carried out follow-up spectroscopic observations of 68
    objects to search for changes in the peak velocities of the H{beta}
    lines.

Description:
    We carried out follow-up observations of 68 objects from our sample
    using four different telescopes: the brightest objects were observed
    with the 2.4m Hiltner telescope at MDM observatory, objects of
    intermediate brightness were observed with the 4m Mayall telescope at
    Kitt Peak National Observatory and the 5m Hale telescope at Palomar
    Observatory, while the faintest objects were observed with the 9.2m
    Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). With the follow-up observations we
    specifically targeted the H{beta} lines of the quasars in our sample,
    although we also did attempt to obtain spectra of the H{alpha} and
    MgII lines whenever possible. The log of observations is included in
    Table 1.

          MgII (2800) line, we give the S/N in the continuum near this line,
          at 2900 Angstroms.

Note (1):
    f = The spectrum of J092712 includes two sets of narrow lines therefore we
        report the properties of each set in separate rows. The first row gives
        the properties of the set that is blueshifted and appears to be at the
        same redshift as the broad lines. The second row gives the properties
        of the set that is reshifted and has no broad lines associated with it.
Note (2): Integrated line fluxes are expressed relative to the integrated
     flux of the [OIII] (5007) line, as measured from the observed
     spectrum, without any corrections. The uncertainty is 5% or less,
     unless otherwise noted.
Note (3): a colon (:) indicates an uncertainty of 10-15%
Note (4): Integrated line fluxes are expressed relative to the integrated
     flux of the [OIII] (5007) line after correcting for Galactic
     extinction, as described in Section 4.2 of the text. The uncertainty
     is 5% or less, unless otherwise noted.
Note (5): After correcting for Galactic extinction (see Section 4.2).
Note (6): Corrected for the finite resolution of the spectrograph as
     described in Section 4.2 of the text. The value is omitted when the
     line is not detected.
