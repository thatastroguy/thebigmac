Abstract:
    Offset active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are AGNs that are in ongoing
    galaxy mergers, which produce kinematic offsets in the AGNs relative
    to their host galaxies. Offset AGNs are also close relatives of dual
    AGNs. We conduct a systematic search for offset AGNs in the Sloan
    Digital Sky Survey by selecting AGN emission lines that exhibit
    statistically significant line-of-sight velocity offsets relative to
    systemic. From a parent sample of 18,314 Type 2 AGNs at z < 0.21, we
    identify 351 offset AGN candidates with velocity offsets of
    50 km/s <|{Delta}v| < 410 km/s. When we account for projection effects
    in the observed velocities, we estimate that 4%-8% of AGNs are offset
    AGNs. We designed our selection criteria to bypass velocity offsets
    produced by rotating gas disks, AGN outflows, and gravitational recoil
    of supermassive black holes, but follow-up observations are still
    required to confirm our candidates as offset AGNs. We find that the
    fraction of AGNs that are offset candidates increases with AGN
    bolometric luminosity, from 0.7% to 6% over the luminosity range
    43 < log (L_bol_) [erg/s] <46. If these candidates are shown to be
    bona fide offset AGNs, then this would be direct observational
    evidence that galaxy mergers preferentially trigger high-luminosity
    AGNs. Finally, we find that the fraction of AGNs that are offset AGN
    candidates increases from 1.9% at z = 0.1 to 32% at z = 0.7, in step
    with the growth in the galaxy merger fraction over the same redshift
    range.

Description:
    Our selection criteria for offset AGNs are as follows. In the OSSY
    catalog (Oh et al. 2011ApJS..195...13O), all forbidden lines are
    forced to have the same kinematics, while all the Balmer lines are fit
    with a separate kinematical model (e.g., Tremonti et al.
    2004ApJ...613..898T). We use the velocities of the forbidden lines,
    Balmer lines, and stellar absorption features measured in OSSY to
    derive line-of-sight velocity offsets of the forbidden and Balmer
    lines relative to the stars.
