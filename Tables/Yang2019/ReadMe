Abstract:
    We present a catalog of 290 "winged" or X-shaped radio galaxies (XRGs)
    extracted from the latest (2014 December 17) data release of the "Very
    Large Array Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeter". We
    have combined these radio images with their counterparts in the TIFR
    GMRT sky survey at 150MHz, in an attempt to identify any low surface
    brightness radio emission present in these sources. This has enabled
    us to assemble a sample of 106 "strong" XRG candidates and 184
    "probable" XRG candidates whose XRG designation needs to be verified
    by further observations. The present sample of 290 XRG candidates is
    almost twice as large as the number of XRGs currently known.
    Twenty-five of our 290 XRG candidates (9 "strong" and 16 "probable")
    are identified as quasars. Double-peaked narrow emission lines are
    seen in the optical spectra of three of the XRG candidates (two
    "strong" and one "probable"). Nearly 90% of the sample is located in
    the FR II domain of the Owen-Ledlow diagram. A few of the strong XRG
    candidates have a rather flat radio spectrum (spectral index {alpha}
    flatter than -0.3) between 150MHz and 1.4GHz, or between 1.4 and 5GHz.
    Since this is not expected for lobe-dominated extragalactic radio
    sources (like nearly all known XRGs), these sources are particularly
    suited for follow-up radio imaging and near-simultaneous measurement
    of the radio spectrum.

Description:
    We have assembled the present catalog of 290 "winged" or X-shaped
    radio galaxy (XRG) candidates by searching in the latest VLA FIRST
    survey data release version 14Dec17 (see VIII/92). This version covers
    10575deg^2^ of the sky and contains 946432 radio sources, including
    those reported in the earlier data releases from 1993 through 2011.
    The survey achieved a typical rms noise of 0.15mJy and a resolution of
    ~5" at 1.4GHz.

    Images from FIRST were combined with the 150MHz radio continuum images
    reported in Intema+, 2017, J/A+A/598/A78 ; see Section 3 for further
    explanations.

    The radio contours were then overlaid on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
    (SDSS) SDSS i-band and/or Digital Sky Survey (DSS) red filter image of
    the source. See Section 4 for further explanations.
