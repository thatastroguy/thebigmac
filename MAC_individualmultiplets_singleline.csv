Coordinates come from Wrobel+2014. Separations for J1502SE and SW give the separations between these two components. Separation for J1502P is for approximate separation between J1502P and inner 'binary' (given by the original separation from Fu+2011).

AGNs have been suggested via optical diagnostics in 838  and 839 but 838 is more likely to be due to shocks. Turner and O'sullivan find 838 best modeled by a hard component from XRBs and a soft component from hot gas from SB driven wind. 839 was suggested to have a faint absorbed nucleus by Turner+. O'sullivan+ also find an AGN component could explain the emission or it could be that the hard emission is explained by a power law driven by XRBs. 839 is not detected by NuSTAR by
