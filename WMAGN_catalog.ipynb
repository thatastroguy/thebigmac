    "    - Title: INSPIRALLING SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES: A NEW SIGNPOST FOR GALAXY MERGERS\n",
    "        - Abstract: We present a new technique for observationally identifying galaxy mergers spectroscopically rather than through host galaxy imaging. Our technique exploits the dynamics of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) powering active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in merger-remnant galaxies. Because structure in the universe is built up through galaxy mergers and nearly all galaxies host a central SMBH, some galaxies should possess two SMBHs near their centers as the result of a recent merger. These SMBHs spiral to the center of the resultant merger-remnant galaxy, and one or both of the SMBHs may power AGNs. Using the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, we have examined 1881 red galaxies, of which 91 exhibit [O III] and Hβ emission lines indicative of Seyfert 2 activity. Of these, 32 AGNs have [O III] emission-line redshifts significantly different from the redshifts of the host galaxies' stars, corresponding to velocity offsets of ~50 km s–1 to ~300 km s–1. Two of these AGNs exhibit double-peaked [O III] emission lines, while the remaining 30 AGNs each exhibit a single set of velocity-offset [O III] emission lines. After exploring a variety of physical models for these velocity offsets, we argue that the most likely explanation is inspiralling SMBHs in merger-remnant galaxies. Based on this interpretation, we find that roughly half of the red galaxies hosting AGNs are also merger remnants, which implies that mergers may trigger AGN activity in red galaxies. The AGN velocity offsets we find imply a merger fraction of ~30% and a merger rate of ~3 mergers Gyr–1 for red galaxies at redshifts 0.34 < z < 0.82.\n",

    "        - Abstract: Double-peaked [O III] profiles in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) may provide evidence for the existence of dual AGNs, but a good diagnostic for selecting them is currently lacking. Starting from ~7000 active galaxies in Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7, we assemble a sample of 87 type 2 AGNs with double-peaked [O III] profiles. The nuclear obscuration in the type 2 AGNs allows us to determine redshifts of host galaxies through stellar absorption lines. We typically find that one peak is redshifted and another is blueshifted relative to the host galaxy. We find a strong correlation between the ratios of the shifts and the double peak fluxes. The correlation can be naturally explained by the Keplerian relation predicted by models of co-rotating dual AGNs. The current sample statistically favors that most of the [O III] double-peaked sources are dual AGNs and disfavors other explanations, such as rotating disk and outflows. These dual AGNs have a separation distance at ~1 kpc scale, showing an intermediate phase of merging systems. The appearance of dual AGNs is about ~10–2, impacting on the current observational deficit of binary supermassive black holes with a probability of ~10–4 (Boroson & Lauer).\n",

    "        - Abstract: We present a sample of 167 type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with double-peaked [O III] λλ4959,5007 narrow emission lines, selected from the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The double-peaked profiles can be well modeled by two velocity components, blueshifted and redshifted from the systemic velocity. Half of these objects have a more prominent redshifted component. In cases where the Hβ emission line is strong, it also shows two velocity components whose line-of-sight (LOS) velocity offsets are consistent with those of [O III]. The relative LOS velocity offset between the two components is typically a few hundred km s-1, larger by a factor of ~1.5 than the line full width at half maximum of each component. The offset correlates with the host stellar velocity dispersion σ*. The host galaxies of this sample show systematically larger σ*, stellar masses, and concentrations, and older luminosity-weighted mean stellar ages than a regular type 2 AGN sample matched in redshift, [O III] λ5007 equivalent width, and luminosity; they show no significant difference in radio properties. These double-peaked features could be due to narrow-line region kinematics, or binary black holes. The statistical properties do not show strong preference for or against either scenario, and spatially resolved optical imaging, spectroscopy, radio or X-ray follow-up are needed to draw firm conclusions.\n",

    "        - Abstract: We present active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) having double-peaked profiles of [O III]λλ5007, 4959 and other narrow emission lines, motivated by the prospect of finding candidate binary AGNs. These objects were identified by means of a visual examination of 21,592 quasars at z < 0.7 in SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7). Of the spectra with adequate signal-to-noise, 148 spectra exhibit a double-peaked [O III] profile. Of these, 86 are Type 1 AGNs and 62 are Type 2 AGNs. Only two give the appearance of possibly being optically resolved double AGNs in the SDSS images, but many show close companions or signs of recent interaction. Radio-detected quasars are three times more likely to exhibit a double-peaked [O III] profile than quasars with no detected radio flux, suggesting a role for jet interactions in producing the double-peaked profiles. Of the 66 broad-line (Type 1) AGNs that are undetected in the FIRST survey, 0.9% show double-peaked [O III] profiles. We discuss statistical tests of the nature of the double-peaked objects. Further study is needed to determine which of them are binary AGNs rather than disturbed narrow line regions, and how many additional binaries may remain undetected because of insufficient line-of-sight velocity splitting. Previous studies indicate that 0.1% of SDSS quasars are spatially resolved binaries, with typical spacings of ~10-100 kpc. If a substantial fraction of the double-peaked objects are indeed binaries, then our results imply that binaries occur more frequently at smaller separations (<10 kpc). This suggests that simultaneous fueling of both black holes is more common as the binary orbit decays through these spacings.\n",

    "    - Title: DOUBLE-PEAKED NARROW EMISSION-LINE GALAXIES FROM THE SLOAN DIGITAL SKY SURVEY. I. SAMPLE AND BASIC PROPERTIES\n",
    "        - Abstract: Recently, much attention has been paid to double-peaked narrow emission-line (NEL) galaxies, some of which are suggested to be related to merging galaxies. We make a systematic search to build the largest sample of these sources from Data Release 7 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). With reasonable criteria for fluxes, FWHMs of the emission lines, and separations of the peaks, we select 3030 double-peaked NEL galaxies. In light of the existence of broad Balmer lines and the locations of the two components of double-peaked NELs distinguished by the Kauffmann et al. criteria in the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram, we find that there are 81 Type I active galactic nuclei (AGNs), 837 double Type II AGNs (2-Type II), 708 galaxies with double star-forming components (2-SF), 400 with mixed star-forming and Type II AGN components (Type II + SF), and 1004 unknown-type objects. As a by-product, a sample of galaxies (12,582) with asymmetric or top-flat profiles of emission lines is established. After visually inspecting the SDSS images of the two samples, we find 54 galaxies with dual cores. The present samples can be used to study the dynamics of merging galaxies, the triggering mechanism of black hole activity, the hierarchical growth of galaxies, and the dynamics of narrow line regions driven by outflows and a rotating disk.\n",

    "    - Title: Dual Supermassive Black Hole Candidates in the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey\n",
    "        - Abstract: Dual supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with kiloparsec-scale separations in merger-remnant galaxies are informative tracers of galaxy evolution, but the avenue for identifying them in large numbers for such studies is not yet clear. One promising approach is to target spectroscopic signatures of systems where both SMBHs are fueled as dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs), or where one SMBH is fueled as an offset AGN. Dual AGNs may produce double-peaked narrow AGN emission lines, while offset AGNs may produce single-peaked narrow AGN emission lines with line-of-sight velocity offsets relative to the host galaxy. We search for such dual and offset systems among 173 Type 2 AGNs at z < 0.37 in the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey (AGES), and we find two double-peaked AGNs and five offset AGN candidates. When we compare these results to a similar search of the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey and match the two samples in color, absolute magnitude, and minimum velocity offset, we find that the fraction of AGNs that are dual SMBH candidates increases from z = 0.25 to z = 0.7 by a factor of ~6 (from 2/70 to 16/91, or $2.9^{+3.6}_{-1.9}\\%$ to $18^{+5}_{-5}\\%$). This may be associated with the rise in the galaxy merger fraction over the same cosmic time. As further evidence for a link with galaxy mergers, the AGES offset and dual AGN candidates are tentatively ~3 times more likely than the overall AGN population to reside in a host galaxy that has a companion galaxy (from 16/173 to 2/7, or $9^{+3}_{-2}\\%$ to $29^{+26}_{-19}\\%$). Follow-up observations of the seven offset and dual AGN candidates in AGES will definitively distinguish velocity offsets produced by dual SMBHs from those produced by narrow-line region kinematics, and will help sharpen our observational approach to detecting dual SMBHs.\n",

    "    - Title: IDENTIFICATION OF OUTFLOWS AND CANDIDATE DUAL ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI IN SDSS QUASARS AT z = 0.8-1.6\n",
    "        - Abstract: We present a sample of 131 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at redshifts 0.8 < z < 1.6 with double peaks in either of the high-ionization narrow emission lines [Ne V] λ3426 or [Ne III] λ3869. These sources were selected with the intention of identifying high-redshift analogs of the z < 0.8 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with double-peaked [O III] λ5007 lines, which might represent AGN outflows or dual AGNs. Lines of high ionization potential are believed to originate in the inner, highly photoionized portion of the narrow line region, and we exploit this assumption to investigate the possible kinematic origins of the double-peaked lines. For comparison, we measure the [Ne V] λ3426 and [Ne III] λ3869 double peaks in low-redshift (z < 0.8) [O III]-selected sources. We find that [Ne V] λ3426 and [Ne III] λ3869 show a correlation between line splitting and line width similar to that of [O III] λ5007 in other studies, and the velocity splittings are correlated with the quasar Eddington ratio. These results suggest an outflow origin for at least a subset of the double peaks, allowing us to study the high-ionization gas kinematics around quasars. However, we find that a non-negligible fraction of our sample show no evidence for an ionization stratification. For these sources, the outflow scenario is less compelling, leaving the dual AGN scenario as a viable possibility. Finally, we find that our sample shows an anti-correlation between the velocity-offset ratio and luminosity ratio of the components, which is a potential dynamical argument for the presence of dual AGNs. Therefore, this study serves as a first attempt at extending the selection of candidate dual AGNs to higher redshifts.\n",

The double-peaked narrow-line profiles can be well modeled by two velocity components, respectively blueshifted and redshifted with respect to the systemic recession velocity. This paper presents 20 double-peaked NEL galaxies and AGNs found from LAMOST DR1 using a search method based on a multi-Gaussian fit of the narrow emission lines. Among them, ten have already been published by other authors, either listed as genuine double-peaked NEL objects or as asymmetric NEL objects, and the remaining ten are original discoveries. We discuss some possible origins for the double-peaked narrow-line features, such as interaction between jet and narrow line regions, interaction with companion galaxies, and black hole binaries. Spatially resolved optical imaging and/or follow-up observations in other spectral bands are needed to further discuss the physical mechanisms at work.\n",

We assemble a large sample of 325 candidates with double-peaked or strong asymmetric narrow emission lines, with 33 objects therein appearing optically resolved dual-cored structures, close companions, or signs of recent interaction on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey images. A candidate from LAMOST (J074810.95+281349.2) is also stressed here based on the kinematic and spatial decompositions of the double-peaked narrow emission line target, with analysis from the cross-referenced Mapping Nearby Galaxies at the Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey datacube. MaNGA enables us to constrain the origin of double peaks for these sources, and with the IFU data we infer that the most promising origin of double-peaked profiles for LAMOST J074810.95+281349.2 is the ‘Rotation Dominated  + Disturbance’ structure.\n",

    "    - CCD imaging and spectroscopic observations reveal Q1009-252 to be a pair of quasars with a nearby foreground quasar. The similarity in their spectra, the existence of intervening Mg II absorption in both spectra, brightness of the components A and B, and that they are at identical redshifts suggests the pair may be a lensed quasar system. No lens is observed, though deeper imaging may be needed. However, the detection of [N III] in component B alone and not in A is at odds with the lens interpretation, and it cannot be readily explained by an extinction hypothesis. The equivalent widths of prominent emission lines also differ between the two spectra. The binary hypothesis cannot be ruled out, but a large amount of evidence can be reconciled with a combination of a lens scenario along with differential reddening.\n",

It depends on the competing ionization level produced by the diffuse UV background and the flux by the nearby QSO.

Stacked frames reveal no sign of a third component, which would be indicative of a lens galaxy, down to a magnitude of R=22.5. H band imaging yields similar results: the two components are resolved, the flux ratios differ significantly (1.5x larger) than the R and I band flux ratios, and no evidence for a third component is seen, despite the fact that any lens brighter than H=17.4 would have been detected. The quotient of their optical spectra reveal strong signs evidence for differences between the spectra in terms of equivalent widths and related emission features. VLA imaging, shallow and deeper, do not reveal any sign of radio emission coincident with the brighter of the two components (with 5 arcsec), and therefore this is classified as a radio-quiet/radio-quiet system. Einstein de-Sitter cosmology places strong constraints on teh lens hypothesis, while lambda-cosmology cannot for or against the lens hypthesis based on the detection limits here.

The X-ray emission is estimated to be at least a factor 5 fainter than the minimum flux estimated for the foreground lens, and even if the observed X-ray emission was associated with a foreground cluster at z~0.5, the cluster is not massive enough to cause the observed lensed images of Um 425. In fact the geometry of the system argues that diffuse X-ray emission does not arise from a foreground cluster at all, but rather by a cluster at the redshifts of the quasars. The diffuse emission is observed closer to the primary component (brighter of the two) rather than dimmer one, which is the opposite of what would be expected  in a lens scenario... the cluster should be closer to the dimmer component.

The Fe K-alpha line is observed in the spectrum of NGC 3690, and the spectral properties agree with this AGN being CT, strongly arguing that the CT AGN inferred from the earlier BeppoSAX observations resides in this galaxy (global fitting of the Arp 299 system confirmed earlier concllusion of the presence of a CT AGN). IC 694(?) is a bit more ambiguous, as rather extreme conditions could produce the observed emission line at 6.7 keV (the 6.7 keV line from highly ionized Fe can be produced by a high-temperature plasma); the data do not rule out a starburst origin, but like it was said before, the conditions would need to be rather extreme. Thus it remains a strong possibility that IC 694(?) also harbors an AGN which is fainter and not highly absorbed. Thus, this system quite possible consists of one CT AGN and one faint unobscured AGN. Unfortunately they do not list the source coordinates from Chandra (which would have been best), and while they list XMM coordinates, these look less accurate.

They find significant differences in the optical spectra between the two quasars, particulasrly in the strength of the C IV line and the presence of strong absorption in the spectrum of B. They find redshifts of 4.228 for A and 4.243 for B and they find that the redshifts are marginally consistent with a single value. I will quote these redshifts in the catalog. Imaging results show that there is no recognizable clustering of galaxies near the quasar pair and that there is no apparent enhancement of galaxies in the field; the environment of the quasars differs little from a general field. The data presented strengthens the argument that this is a true pair and not a lensed pair. \n",

Examination of the 2D DEIMOS spectrum revealed that the system has two spatially offset emission regions, separated by 0.17'' on the sky. They derive a redshift of 0.709 for the system, find a velocity difference of ~630 km s-1 between the two components, with a projected separation fo ~1.2kpc. The optical spectroscopic emission line ratios places both emission regions within the Seyfert category. The authors also perform some SED fitting and examine Chandra data, and conclude that the data support the picture of the system hosting a dust obscured AGN.

    "    - A follow-up study on the recoil candidate discovered by Komosso+2008. Shields+ find a third redshift system of weak, narrow emission lines at an intermediate redshift. They discuss many of the scenarios put forth to explain this system: recoil event, binary SMBHs, a superposition of QSOs. Overall it would appear that they argue for more data to be obtained and more analysis to be performed, but based upon their discussions, they make the statement that, since J0927 appears to reside in a substantial cluster and the appearance of a third velocity system close to the spectrum of J0927, the superposition hypothesis does deserve more attention. \n",

    "    - Whereas Magain+ and Haehnelt+ (and others) focused on the nature of the QSO, this paper focuses on the companion and used imfrared and optical imaging. The most intense infrared emission within the companion comes from a region which appears as a hole in the optical. Thus, rather than there being a 'hole' in the optical, there is instead of large cloud of dust roughly 5kpc in length. Deconvolution of the imaging suggests there is a point source lying behindor within the cloud of dust within this companion. The authors rule out the explanation that this point source arises from simply a compact hot cloud of dust. They also rule out the explanation that it arises due to a compact SB region strongly reddened by dust, as it would require some extreme conditions of SF which is not expected in a system like this. (Such extreme brightness of a source arising from SB occurs only in massive galaxies in rich clusters or in quasars, but wouldn't expected in a galaxy like this.) The interpretation that this is a bright AGN actually agrees well with the magnitudes observed for this point source. SED fitting also suggests that an AGN strongly obscured by dust is compatible with the non-detection in the optical and mid-IR. Thus the interprtation that the ULIRG hosts a dust reddened AGN, which manifests as the bright point source within/behind the dust cloud, stands as the best fitting explanation to the data. \n",

    "    - Peculiarities of the spectrum of J1050 was first noticed in the systematic search by Smith+2010 (which first appeared on arxiv in 2009). J1050 shows typical narrow emission lines of an AGN at the redshift of the stellar absorption but the broad H-beta line is blue shifted by 3500 km s-1, which is near the upper end of expected velocities of reoicling SMBHs. The H-alpha shows a similar blue shift. Intensity ratios of the narrow emission lines indicate AGN excitation. J1050 is not within a rich cluster, and the authors argue in generak against a superposition scenario. The unusual spectral characteristics make J1050 a good candidate for a recoil scenario (however with some reasons to be cautious) as well as a good candidate for a double-peaked emitter. No definitive conclusions can at the time be drawn as to whether it is a recoil event or a double-peaked emitter. \n",

    "    - Identified by Hewitt+1989 as a lens system, Faure+2003 uses VLT and HST data to search for lensing cluster or galaxy. Find no evidence for a luminous lens galaxy between the two quasars, find that the galaxy cluster possibly at z~1 (based on photometric redshifts) that is within 5\" of the quasars could not alone explain the images of the quasars (and thus that cluster could not alone be a sufficient lens), and no evidence for a dark lens. Possible lensed host galaxy in component A which at it's luminosity would not be seen in B, but this may also be foreground blue galaxy or actually the host of A itself. Ruled as a likely true quasar pair rather than a lens.\n",

In support of the lens scenario: similar redshifts, colors, and spectral type for both components; anamolous brightness of UM 425A and faintness of UM 425B, and there is some X-ray and H band evidence for an intervening galaxy group. In support of the binary: the sources show significantly different intrinsic absorption; any putative lensing galaxy group is ~6 times X-ray underluminous for the required lensing mass; significantly different UV emission-line profiles; emission line equivalent widths consistent with baldwin effect for apparent luminosity differences. Also, no evidence for intervening lens galaxy near the fainter counterpart UM 425B.\n",

Green+2004 use optical and IR spectroscopy to show that there are significant differences in the profiles of the H-alpha emission (lack of narrow component in B), only B component shows strong BAL systems, the continuum shapes of the systems differ significantly (and this is bolstered by B-R colors), A is the brighter of the two in the optical and IR, but B is radio loud while A is radio quiet.
