Abstract:
    We present a sample of 167 type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with
    double-peaked [OIII]4959,5007 narrow emission lines, selected from the
    Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The
    double-peaked profiles can be well modeled by two velocity components,
    blueshifted and redshifted from the systemic velocity. Half of these
    objects have a more prominent redshifted component. In cases where the
    H{beta} emission line is strong, it also shows two velocity components
    whose line-of-sight (LOS) velocity offsets are consistent with those
    of [OIII]. The relative LOS velocity offset between the two components
    is typically a few hundred km/s, larger by a factor of ~1.5 than the
    line full width at half maximum of each component. The offset
    correlates with the host stellar velocity dispersion {sigma}_*_. The
    host galaxies of this sample show systematically larger {sigma}_*_,
    stellar masses, and concentrations, and older luminosity-weighted mean
    stellar ages than a regular type 2 AGN sample matched in redshift,
    [OIII]5007 equivalent width, and luminosity; they show no significant
    difference in radio properties. These double-peaked features could be
    due to narrow-line region kinematics, or binary black holes.

Note (1): The plate-MJD-fiber found in the SDSS-DR7 for this object is:
          293-51994-016 and not 293-51689-007 as found in the paper; table
          corrected at CDS.
Note (2): Our parent sample is the MPA-JHU SDSS DR7 galaxy sample drawn from
          the SDSS DR7 spectroscopic database (Abazajian et al. 2009,
          Cat. II/294); those include objects spectrally classified as galaxies
          by the specBS pipeline (Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2008, Cat. II/282) or
          quasars that are targeted as galaxies (Strauss et al.
          2002AJ....124.1810S; Eisenstein et al. 2001AJ....122.2267E) and have
          redshifts z<0.7. We adopt redshifts z and stellar velocity dispersions
          {sigma}_*_ from the specBS pipeline. We have checked the accuracy of
          the redshift by refitting the stellar continuum with galaxy templates
          (Liu et al. 2009ApJ...702.1098L), as well as comparing multiple epoch
          spectra of the same objects. See section 2.1 for further details.
Note (3): The typical uncertainty is ~15km/s. A zero is given if the quantity is
          unmeasurable.
Note (4): The typical statistical error is ~10km/s. A zero is given if the
          quantity is unmeasurable.
Note (5): The typical statistical error is ~5km/s. A zero is given if the
          quantity is unmeasurable.
Note (6): The typical statistical error is generally a few times larger than in
          [OIII] since H{beta} is weaker than [OIII]. A zero is given if the
          quantity is unmeasurable.
