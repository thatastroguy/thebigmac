## DR0.1, DR0.15, and initial commits to this GitHub Repo
DR 0.1 consists of work spanning June 2020 - October 2020. Notes on DR0.1 coming soon. 
DR0.15 will consist of all of the DR0.1 files as well as additional files created since then, or modifications to the DR0.1 since it's original creation in 2020. The official first release on GitHub will be DR0.1. This will be followed immediately by a revision to DR0.15 to account for any changes to the documents since then, as well as additional notebooks I am working on. Changes include additions or revisions to the Jupyter Notebook, figures recreated using the Notebook but after October 2020, etc. As of right now, I have only committed files from 2020-2021, and the files from 2021 appear to only be the result of rerunning cells in the original Jupyter Notebook (like figures being recreated.)

DR0.1 source lists are preserved with naming conventions that denote the version number. These deliverables were provided to USNO as part of an internal release in October 2020.
