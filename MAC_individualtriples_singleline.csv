AGNs have been suggested via optical diagnostics in 838  and 839 but 838 is more likely to be due to shocks. Turner and O'sullivan find 838 best modeled by a hard component from XRBs and a soft component from hot gas from SB driven wind. 839 was suggested to have a faint absorbed nucleus by Turner+. O'sullivan+ also find an AGN component could explain the emission or it could be that the hard emission is explained by a power law driven by XRBs. 839 is not detected by NuSTAR by
