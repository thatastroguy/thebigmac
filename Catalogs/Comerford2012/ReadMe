Abstract:
    Merger-remnant galaxies with kiloparsec (kpc) scale separation dual
    active galactic nuclei (AGNs) should be widespread as a consequence of
    galaxy mergers and triggered gas accretion onto supermassive black
    holes, yet very few dual AGNs have been observed. Galaxies with
    double-peaked narrow AGN emission lines in the Sloan Digital Sky
    Survey (SDSS) are plausible dual AGN candidates, but their
    double-peaked profiles could also be the result of gas kinematics or
    AGN-driven outflows and jets on small or large scales. To help
    distinguish between these scenarios, we have obtained spatial profiles
    of the AGN emission via follow-up long-slit spectroscopy of 81
    double-peaked narrow-line AGNs in SDSS at 0.03<=z<=0.36 using Lick,
    Palomar, and MMT Observatories. We find that all 81 systems exhibit
    double AGN emission components with ~kpc projected spatial separations
    on the sky (0.2h^-1^_70_kpc<{Delta}x<5.5h^-1^_70_kpc; median
    {Delta}x=1.1h^-1^_70_kpc), which suggests that they are produced by
    kiloparsec-scale dual AGNs or kiloparsec-scale outflows, jets, or
    rotating gaseous disks.

Description:
    We selected targets from the three catalogs that have identified
    active galaxies in SDSS with double-peaked [OIII] {lambda}5007
    emission lines: Wang et al. (2009, Cat. J/ApJ/705/L76), Liu et al.
    (2010, Cat. J/ApJ/708/427), and Smith et al. (2010,
    Cat. J/ApJ/716/866) (we note that one of the objects in Smith et al.
    2010 was originally identified in Xu & Komossa 2009ApJ...705L..20X).

    We obtained follow-up long-slit spectroscopy, during 2009 and 2010,
    for a sample of 81 double-peaked AGNs at 0.03<=z<=0.36 and
    14.5<=r<=18.5 using the Kast Spectrograph at the Lick 3m telescope
    (pixel size 0.78"), the Double Spectrograph (DBSP) on the Palomar 5m
    telescope (pixel size 0.47" for the red detector and 0.39" for the
    blue detector), and the Blue Channel Spectrograph on the MMT 6.5m
    telescope (pixel size 0.29"). We observed each target twice, with the
    slit at two different position angles, in order to determine the
    orientation of the AGN emission components on the plane of the sky.
