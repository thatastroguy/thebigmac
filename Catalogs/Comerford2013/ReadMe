Abstract:
    Dual supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with kiloparsec-scale
    separations in merger-remnant galaxies are informative tracers of
    galaxy evolution, but the avenue for identifying them in large numbers
    for such studies is not yet clear. One promising approach is to target
    spectroscopic signatures of systems where both SMBHs are fueled as
    dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs), or where one SMBH is fueled as an
    offset AGN. Dual AGNs may produce double-peaked narrow AGN emission
    lines, while offset AGNs may produce single-peaked narrow AGN emission
    lines with line-of-sight velocity offsets relative to the host galaxy.
    We search for such dual and offset systems among 173 Type 2 AGNs at
    z<0.37 in the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey (AGES), and we find two
    double-peaked AGNs and five offset AGN candidates. When we compare
    these results to a similar search of the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey
    and match the two samples in color, absolute magnitude, and minimum
    velocity offset, we find that the fraction of AGNs that are dual SMBH
    candidates increases from z=0.25 to z=0.7 by a factor of ~6 (from 2/70
    to 16/91, or 2.9_-1.9_^+3.6^% to 18_-5_^+5^%). This may be associated
    with the rise in the galaxy merger fraction over the same cosmic time.
    As further evidence for a link with galaxy mergers, the AGES offset
    and dual AGN candidates are tentatively ~3 times more likely than the
    overall AGN population to reside in a host galaxy that has a companion
    galaxy (from 16/173 to 2/7, or 9_-2_^+3^% to 29_-19_^+26^%). Follow-up
    observations of the seven offset and dual AGN candidates in AGES will
    definitively distinguish velocity offsets produced by dual SMBHs from
    those produced by narrow-line region kinematics, and will help sharpen
    our observational approach to detecting dual SMBHs.

Description:
    Our sample consists of a catalog of optical galaxy spectra observed
    for AGES (Kochanek et al. 2012, J/ApJS/200/8; Cool et al.
    2012ApJ...748...10C). Using Hectospec, an optical fiber-fed
    spectrograph with 1.5" fibers on the MMT 6.5m telescope, AGES observed
    7.7deg^2^ of the Bootes field in the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey
    (Jannuzi & Dey 1999ASPC..191..111J). The resultant spectra have a
    wavelength coverage of 3700-9200{AA}, and the spectral resolution is
    6{AA}, yielding R~1000.

    We measured the fluxes of nine emission lines (H{beta}; [OIII]
    {lambda}{lambda}4959, 5007; [OI] {lambda}6300; H{alpha}; [NII]
    {lambda}{lambda}6548, 6584; [SII] {lambda}{lambda}6716, 6731) covered
    in the wavelength range of our sample.
